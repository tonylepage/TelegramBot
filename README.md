# About #

This simple app will run a telegram bot in an App Container on Digital Ocean but you can run on any app platform that supports docker. I use this bot for day trading, to send trading signals to myself.

## Deploying the App on Digital Ocean ##

## Making Changes to Your App ##

As long as you left the default Autodeploy option enabled when you first launched this app, you can now make code changes and see them automatically reflected in your live application. During these automatic deployments, your application will never pause or stop serving request because the App Platform offers zero-downtime deployments.
