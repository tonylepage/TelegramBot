## Making Changes to Your App ##

As long as you left the default Autodeploy option enabled when you first launched this app, you can now make code changes and see them automatically reflected in your live application. During these automatic deployments, your application will never pause or stop serving request because the App Platform offers zero-downtime deployments.


## Learn More ##

You can learn more about the App Platform and how to manage and update your application at https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/apps/.
